# Audio Feature Extraction & Visualization Toolkit

A lightweight audio analysis toolkit for extracting, visualizing, and comparing
audio features from real-world audio signals.  
The project focuses on **audio understanding and signal processing**, rather than
training machine learning models.

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for audio analysis that includes:
- loading and preprocessing raw audio files,
- extracting common time-domain and spectral audio features,
- visualizing audio representations,
- comparing features across different sound categories.

It is designed as a **portfolio-ready project** for audio and signal processing roles.
